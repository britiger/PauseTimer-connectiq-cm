PauseTimer for Garmin Connect IQ (CriticalMaps Edition)
=======================================================

This is a datafield for Garmin Connect IQ devices. The field shows the time you paused during an activity. It is useful for Garmin Edge devices. You should activate AutoPause. If the activity is pauses the time while pause will be calculated. The CriticalMaps Edition send your position to the API of [CriticalMap](https://www.criticalmaps.net/), every 5 minutes (this limitation comes from Garmin Connect IQ).

You can find the Standard Version of this PauseTimer at https://github.com/britiger/PauseTimer-connectiq

This is a replacement for "Zeit im Stand"(German) of my good old Garmin eTrex HCx.

Tested on Garmin Edge 1030.
